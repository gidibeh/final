	groceries.totalPrice = "35$"
// Change totalPrice by 35$. Does this key was also modified in the copied object ?
//Yes, because its a reference to the original object

//Ex 3
	groceries.other.payed = false;
// Change payed by false. Does this key was also modified in the copied object ? Why ?
 
// Yes, same reason as before in Ex 2. The object is a reference to a location in memory, which we just changed
